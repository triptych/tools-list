# Open source, experimental, and tiny tools roundup

**This is a list of smaller tools that might be useful in building your game/website/interactive project.** Although I’ve mostly also included ‘standards’, this list has a focus on artful tools & toys that are as fun to use as they are functional.

The goal of this list is to enable making entirely outside of closed production ecosystems or walled software gardens.

Additions? Make a pull request and add a suggestion under the appropriate heading, in the same format as the list. (If you're not comfortable with Git, just email me - everest.pipkin @ gmail. ☺︎︎ )
